Let's Play the Game of Tile Flip

Tile flip is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped to face up over each turn.
The objective of the game is to turn over the pairs of matching cards.
It is a single player ga,e particularly good for young children, though adults may find it challenging and simulating as well.
The scheme is often used in quiz shows and can be employed as an educational game.
